### Grocery Hero, Virtual Reality Edutainment (2016)
This design project was done as part of the capstone for a User Experience course at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My teammates and I prototyped and conducted UX research on an VR edutainment experience that simulated grocery shopping and aimed to challenge the players in balancing their grocery buying habits in order to minimize food wastage.
