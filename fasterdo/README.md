### FasterDO for iOS (2015)

This design project was done as part of a project for an Interaction Design course at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My teammates and I prototyped and conducted UX research on an iOS app for group and project management for students of the university.

The Team: Jasmine Tan, Nguyen Ha, Jan Lee, Leoson Hoay
